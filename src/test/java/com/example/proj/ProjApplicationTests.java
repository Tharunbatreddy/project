        // The method is currently empty because:
        // 1. It is typically not necessary to add any custom logic to this test.
        // 2. Spring Boot automatically runs this test to check if the application context
        //    loads without issues during the startup phase.
        //

        // are loaded, you could inject those beans and verify their existence:
        //
        // If this test is not needed for your use case, you can throw an exception
        // to indicate it's not implemented, like so:

        // Uncomment the line below if you want to explicitly fail the test
